## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--

Iâ€™m currently working on various school-related and small personal projects, with a focus on learning the fundamentals of computer science in Fundies 1, but have prior coding experience. Iâ€™m always open to collaborating on new projects and eager to help with any programming tasks, whether itâ€™s problem-solving, coding, or debugging. Feel free to reach out to me at guntupalli.pr@northeastern.edu or pranavguntupalli10@gmail.com if you're interested in collaborating or need assistance. My pronouns are he/him.
